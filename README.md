# What is Quotex?

Quotex is an online broker that offers binary options, a financial
product where your payoff is "all or nothing" within a defined
time frame.

For example, if you believe Microsoft stock will trade above \$100 in
the next 2 minutes and it does, you receive your money back plus a
premium.

If it doesn't, you lose all your money.

While the platform is user-friendly and appealing for beginners, the
high-risk nature of binary options and lack of regulation make it a
questionable choice.

## Is Quotex Regulated?

The biggest red flag is that Quotex has no regulatory approval.

Reputable financial authorities such as the SEC or FCA do not regulate
the platform.

The company behind Quotex, Maxbit LLC, is registered in St. Vincent and
Grenadines, a known offshore tax haven with poor regulatory oversight.

This lack of regulation means there is no guarantee of compensation if
the broker goes bankrupt.

Several European financial regulators, including CMVM (Portugal), CNMV
(Spain), and CONSOB (Italy), have issued warnings against Quotex,
stating it is not authorized to provide financial services in those
regions.
